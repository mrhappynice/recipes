Below is a simple, gluten‐free, and vegan pie crust recipe using coconut flour and flax seed (as a binder) that you can try. Keep in mind that coconut flour is very absorbent, so the dough might feel crumbly at first—letting it sit or chilling it for a short while helps bring it together.

### Ingredients
- **Flax Egg:**  
  • 2 tablespoons ground flax seed  
  • 6 tablespoons water  
- **Wet Ingredients:**  
  • 1/2 cup solid coconut oil (chilled) *(or use melted coconut oil, but solid works best for flakiness)*  
- **Dry Ingredients:**  
  • 3/4 cup coconut flour (sifted)  
  • 1/4 teaspoon salt  
- *(Optional: For a slightly sweet crust, add 1–2 tablespoons of your preferred sweetener and/or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.)*

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Flax Egg:**  
   In a small bowl, combine the ground flax seed with water. Stir well and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens.

2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:**  
   In a medium bowl, beat the chilled coconut oil with the flax egg (and sweetener/vanilla if using) until well combined.

3. **Incorporate Dry Ingredients:**  
   Gradually add the coconut flour and salt into the wet mixture. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough seems too dry or crumbly, let it rest for 5–10 minutes so the flour can fully absorb the liquids. If needed, you can add a teaspoon or two of water to help bind it further.

4. **Form the Crust:**  
   Press the dough evenly into a greased 9-inch pie pan. (If the dough is too crumbly to roll out, press it firmly with your fingers until it covers the bottom and sides.)

5. **Pre-bake (Blind Bake):**  
   Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10–15 minutes until it’s just set and lightly golden around the edges.

6. **Cool and Fill:**  
   Remove from the oven and let the crust cool before adding your chosen pie filling.

### Tips
- **Chilling:** If you find the dough difficult to work with, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes before pressing it into the pan.
- **Texture Adjustments:** Coconut flour can vary by brand. If your dough feels too dry, you can add a little extra water (a teaspoon at a time) until you reach the desired consistency.
- **Flavor Variations:** For savory pies, simply omit the sweetener and vanilla.

This crust is versatile and works well as a base for both sweet and savory pies. Enjoy your baking!
