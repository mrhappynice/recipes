- need a fat like butter or coconut oil (careful with the coconut oil, too much can make you nauseous)
- honey + some sweeteners - eythritol, etc. sweeten to taste
- coconut cream. not all made the same, some with high fat content and some with more water. You may have to cook down a bit to thicken.
- cocoa powder

- low low heat.
- melt the butter
- add cocoa powder

- add honey + sweeteners

- add coconut cream, start with a little, add and mix until light to dark brown. your preference.

I let mine cool a bit before topping fruit, ice cream sandwiches etc.
